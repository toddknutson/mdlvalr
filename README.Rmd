This R package can be used to facilitate validation of MDL pipelines with R.

## Installation

Installing the package from a GitHub Enterprise (organization) account requires a few extra arguments, including an [authorization token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.2/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). The authorization token is set to expire on 2023-09-30. Please let me know if it is expired or you have any other issues installing from GitHub. 

The package also depends on the `plyranges` R package from Bioconductor. So make sure that is installed first.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# If you need to install plyranges
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("plyranges")

# Install mdlvalr
remotes::install_github("msi/mdlvalr", host = "github.umn.edu/api/v3", auth_token = "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")
```


## About the package

The design rationale for the package can be found in the [About](./docs/articles/about.html) article/vignette.


## Examples

Follow an example analysis in the [`hybcap`](./docs/articles/hybcap.html) pipeline article/vignette.

## Notes

This package uses generic functions with pipeline specific methods. To explore the source code within R, try the following examples.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(mdlvalr)

# List the available methods for this generic function
methods(compare_vars)

# Show the source code for the method: "hybcap"
getAnywhere(compare_vars.hybcap)
mdlvalr:::compare_vars.hybcap
```
