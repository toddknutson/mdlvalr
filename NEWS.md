# mdlvalr 0.4.0

* Removed `validate_samples()` function because it was too specific to a simple use-case. Instead, a standardized sample sheet is supplied to the `get_data()` function to start the analysis. Creating the sample sheet can be done in a variety of ways and is out of scope right now.
* Updated documentation
* Changed the getting started article/vignette to and example for the `hybcap` pipeline specifically. In addition, the example files included with the package were streamlined. And the vignette can be run anywhere using the provided input files.
* Added a new article/vignette called "About" that describes the big picture for the package and it's functions
